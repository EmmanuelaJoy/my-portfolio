            <strong>ABOUT ME</strong>
        </div>
        <p>Hello there and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Emmanuela Joy, and i'm a student at Moringa School
            undertaking the Software Development program. I successfully completed a Diploma in Business Information
            Technology at KCA University and briefly worked as an intern in the same university. I worked in Computer
            Maintenance where my main duty of offering technical support to students and lecturers included but was not
            limited to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fixing network problems.</li>
            <li>Installing and updating software applications.</li>
            <li>Setting up and maintaining hardware equipment.</li>
            <li>Diagnosing and repairing faulty computers.</li>
            <li>Recording inventory.</li>
            <li>Printing documents.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I was however more interested in pursuing a carreer in programming. I learnt the basics of programming during
            my time in KCA and i decided to join Moringa School in order to increase and sharpen my skills.I hope to
            make the most of my time at Moringa in order to acquire skills that will set me on my journey of becoming a
            software developer, capable of providing technological solutions to various business problems.</p>
